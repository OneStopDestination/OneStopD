    - ! 'Vishesh Ravi  '
    - B.Com  in 2005
    - ! "The excerpts of an interview of Vishesh Ravi about his journey from running
      an NGO to Delhiâ€™s Assembly:\nQ: How was your journey from a common man to an
      MLA now?\nVishesh Ravi (VR): Well its been very good and as you know everything
      requires some hardwork, as success cannot be achieved without it. We did it
      and the result is in front of you.\nQ: As far as we know you work for a non-profit
      organisation named 'Delhi Vikas Sanastha'. So when and how it came into you
      mind to join politics and Aam Aadmi Party?\nVR: See the NGO and the politics
      both will be different each other. I thought that politics will be an added
      advantage to provide a necessary platform to extend helping hand to the people
      and it will give me an opportunity to do my work in a more organized manner.\nQ:
      Why did you join the Aam Aadmi Party?\nVR: Because I think that the ideology
      of AAP is the logical one, it speaks truth, fairness and talks about the people's
      problem. It provides the platform to serve the people, thats why I joined the
      AAP.\nQ: So were you knowing Arvind Kejriwal earlier? Were you the part of Anna
      movement against the corruption?\nVR: No, I was not the part of Anna movement
      but I really liked the issues they were fighting for. I was not knowing Arvind
      Kejriwal before the Anna movement in Delhi. All that I knew was that he was
      one of the leading faces in that movement.\nQ: How you came into the contact
      of Arvind Kejriwal formally?\nVR: Actually as you know that we run a non-profit
      organization in Delhi namely 'Delhi Vikas Santhan' since the last 10 years actually.
      \ My father started it and now I am carrying it forward. We help people in fighting
      for their issues. So while doing this all public work, I came into contact of
      Arvind Kejriwal Ji.\nQ: Do you have any role model in real life or politics?
      Any person you follow or you like?\nVR: Well there are couple of personalities
      I like, but the one I really admire is Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, and yeah of
      course Arvind Kejriwal and Anna Hazare are also the personalities I really admire.\nQ:
      While talking about the elections you cannot neglect the expenses that you incur
      during the entire campaigning and managing meetings? So how did you arrange
      funds to bear those expenses?\nVR: Most of the funds I arranged on my own and
      yes there was also some help from the party fund. Plus we went door to door
      and took donations for the party.  \nQ: Its been now almost clear that you will
      be sitting in the opposition. So what will be your next step or plans?\nVR:
      Well we work according to the party plans.We will do the right politics and
      will focus on those issues and the problems of the public that we had promised
      to look after before the elections.\n\nFor more information on Vishesh Ravi:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/vishesh.ravi?fref=ts\nhttps://www.facebook.com/VisheshRaviforMLA\nFor

    - ! "Arvind Kejriwal was an Income Tax Commissioner before he left his job and
      started working as a full time activist fighting against corruption. He was
      one of the most prominent figures who pushed for the Right-To-Information to
      be passed as a law. He also worked a lot in raising the mass awareness about
      RTI. Arvind along with Sri Anna Hazare ignited the biggest fight against corruption
      at a level which was never seen in last 4 decades. On innumerous occasions he
      has busted and unfolded many of the scams involving leading businessmen, bureaucrats,
      and politicians of India. He also sat for a 15 days fast to raise voice against
      sufferings caused to comman men by unjustified and irrational high charges for
      water-electricity.\r\n"
